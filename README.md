# node.js-express-CRUD-app

- This is a CRUD application made with Node.js and Express.

- No database was used, such as MongoDB. I used only hardcoded json data for the project.

- The idea of this basic project was to view, create, update and delete  some hardcoded users.

- There is also a logger middleware function that logs the time and type of request to the webpages in the /public folder.
